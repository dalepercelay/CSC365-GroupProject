We will be owning animals in a world called HeeHeeHeeHee and the shop will have the animals' names, statistics, price. We plan on selling animals only for one fight to users, where they can temporarily use it to fight enemies to get more money if they win. We will then create a ranking board for users based on how much gold they have for a week.
